Hello World! My name is Everett Diuguid.  
I am an aspiring coder/web-developer currently enrolled in The Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill.  I am an Alumni of Appalachain State University 
with degrees in History (BA) and Spanish Language and Liturature (BA).  Prior to starting my journey through coding, I worked for over a decade in the service and hospitality industry, 
gaining a love for the culinary arts but more importantly building a strong work ethic with a primary focus on attention to detail.
I spend my free time outside; tending to vegetables in the garden, hiking or biking through North Carolinas amazing state parks, or at the computer building up my coding abilities.
I have strong passion for live music, photography, and all things food.
